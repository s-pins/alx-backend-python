# alx-backend-python

### Overview  
This repository contains a collection of backend-Python modules, exercises and mini-projects created as part of the curricula for **ALX School**’s backend Python track. Each folder tackles a specific topic (generators, decorators, async, unit/integration tests, etc.).  

---

## 🧠 Contents  
| Folder | Topic | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `0x00-python-generators`        | Generators | Hands-on work with Python generator functions and comprehensions. |
| `0x01-python-decorators`        | Decorators | Building and applying custom decorators, chaining decorators, introspection. |
| `0x02-python-async-operations`  | Async / Contexts | Using `async`, `await`, context managers, and asynchronous design patterns. |
| `0x03-unitests_and_integration_tests` | Testing | Writing unit tests, integration tests, mocking, and test-driven design. |

## 🎯 Goals  
- Strengthen backend-Python fundamentals: data structures, control flow, OO, modules.  
- Master advanced topics: generators, decorators, asynchronous programming.  
- Develop testing-first mindset: write tests, validate code, maintain robustness.  
- Prepare for real-world backend roles (API, microservices, automation) with clean, testable code.
