# 0x03 — Unit Tests & Integration Tests  

## 📚 Overview  
This directory contains code exercises and example tests for **unit testing** and **integration testing** in Python. The goal is to practice writing robust tests using standard frameworks, so that backend services are reliable, maintainable, and well-verified.  

---

## 🎯 What’s Inside  
- **Unit tests**: Focused, isolated tests that verify individual functions or small units of logic.  
- **Integration tests**: Tests that check how different parts of your system communicate and integrate (e.g., modules, external dependencies).  

---

## 🛠️ Why This Matters  
- **Maintain code quality**: Unit tests catch regressions early.  
- **Prevent integration bugs**: Integration tests help ensure that the pieces of your application work together as expected.  
- **Build confidence**: Testing-first (or heavy-testing) mindset leads to more reliable backend applications.  
- **Prepare for real-world backend dev**: In production code, you’ll often need both types of testing to ship safely.
